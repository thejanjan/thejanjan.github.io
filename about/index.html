                <h2>bio</h2>
                i was born in february 2002. so, at the time of writing (9/14/23) i'm 21. you can use any pronouns with me. 
                currently, i live in eugene, oregon. i'm graduating from the University of Oregon in march 2024. 
                i spend most of my time online, usually developing various games or working on music. 
                but i also like to relax by watching videos or playing games with others too.
                <br /><br />
                typically, i enjoy a lot of overstimulating games, like challenging celeste maps or ultrakill. but it doesn't usually have to 
                be flashy, games with a lot of depth are sufficient for me as well (binding of isaac, but also most rpgs). i suppose it's the 
                high immersion factor that does the trick for me. 
                <br /><br />
                i've been diagnosed with crohn's disease since 2018, which has been an active detriment to my well-being. i still give it my all 
                when doing work, and i've been able to prove that i can exceed myself despite how unforgiving it is, but i need to ask folks to be 
                more patient with me on occasion if i'm having too many rough GI issues at once.
                <br /><br />
                i've been actively online since i was 6, which has taught me how to be highly proficient in internet culture and online communication. 
                this has been a tremendous advantage for me in remote work -- my typing speed tops out at around 170 wpm, which allows me to be very comfortably 
                precise and accurate when communicating ideas online, which is something that i see folks struggle with often.

                <br /><br /><hr />
                <h2>game making</h2>
                when i was about 8 or 9, i found myself commonly frequenting an online forum board for a random, obscure puzzle game. 
                um, i honestly don't even like puzzle games too much, i was mainly there because it's where my brother was, lol. 
                but a couple people on the forums started to develop their own small games in game maker, and i wanted to get into it as well. 
                <br /><br />
                so i did! and it worked out pretty well.
                <br /><br />
                starting at around 10 i was clocking in several hundred hours putting out tiny, pitiful game projects.
                i got comfortable with the different pipelines of producing and integrating assets, or picking out and designing game audio, 
                i essentially got a free ticket to working with a visual game engine. i learned so many coding fundamentals along the way, so 
                i can even add that i've been programming for over a decade as well.
                <br /><br />
                the games from this time were, well, not great. but i made over a hundred of them, i learned about the challenges and difficulties of 
                so many different kinds of games. these project files still live on in dust on old, dying hard drives. this website has screenshots from 
                a handful of the more tangible ones i would make later on.

                <br /><br /><hr />
                <h2>music</h2>
                i own a couple instruments, namely a piano keyboard and an accordion. 
                but my musical background is mainly rooted in percussion, which i was most active in during high school. 
                i auditioned and was accepted for oregon's all-state bands, and was also a part of around six or seven 
                different school ensembles as well (percussion, wind, jazz, concert, another jazz, marching, and another percussion one). 
                <br /><br />
                i was the percussion section leader in all of them, minus a jazz and concert band. a lot of my leadership roots come 
                from this time, when i had to step up and help others learn how to perform music in stressful contexts, which taught me 
                a lot of key talents in patience, being supportive, and how to be a role model. 
                
                <br /><br />
                then covid happened my senior year, and i had to let it all go before i was ready to give it up. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

                <br /><br /><hr />
                <h2>toontown</h2>
                i feel the need to give this game a dedicated section down here, since it's quite special to me.
                <br /><br />
                i played disney's original toontown online for a few years, starting around 2009 or so, before it eventually closed in 2013. 
                in hindsight, it was a very boring game, but i was a kid and it was a kids game, so it was fine to play. 
                game shuts down, toontown rewritten becomes a thing, then stops doing anything meaningful with their game after 2015. 
                i played it a bit, but lost interest halfway through once i realized nothing was different. nostalgia never pushed me too far.
                <br /><br />
                though, the toontown community would have a very complex web of different folks trying to do what toontown rewritten failed at, 
                usually by adapting or upgrading the base game with new features in their own private servers. i kept up with them for a bit, but 
                never got tremendously into them.
                <br /><br />
                in late 2020, i joined the moderation team for the first server that actually looked like it could hold a candle up, which was toontown: corporate clash.
                clash was interesting, because even though it was ugly and sucked and felt like a garbage fire, it at least had enough changes to differentiate itself 
                from the original game (along with meaningful progression and better gameplay) that it was able to pull me in for a lot longer.
                <br /><br />
                i decided that i wanted to help work on the game in 2021, so i joined the tech team cautiously, unsure of how much my game development background would pull through for the project.
                two years later, my presence heavily changed the outcome of the game forever. i was one of the game's lead developers, spending dozens of hours a week (for free) implementing new 
                battles, content, and modern MMO systems to revitalize the game and help give it a spirit that the community had hoped for, but never received, a decade after its lights went out. 
                <br /><br />
                i met so many amazing people in that time, several of whom i'm still close with, and learned what it was like to work with amazingly talented artists and people. 
                it was so exciting, so messy, and so <i>fun</i> to work on a project of that caliber. to take a completely dead, rotten, forgotten codebase, type enough letters out, and come out 
                with a game that still bolsters a freighteningly passionate community, that people are still highly invested in.
                <br /><br />
                i log in on occasion to pull up the game's group tracker, something that i created entirely myself from scratch over a period of several months, and see people still using it to 
                organize boss and dungeon raids, the same raids that i used to grind out over a decade ago as a kid.
                <br /><br />
                it's really something special. there's nothing quite like game development. i wouldn't pick anything else as a career.
