                this website serves as a general portfolio for my work.
                i'm a software engineer with a strong orientation in game design.
                i've developed a deep understanding of what it takes to produce games after
                12 years of persuing it passionately as a hobby.
                i've also worked as a technical manager and director for different dev teams,
                between the scale of small gamejam projects and AA-sized game studios (60-100 staff).

                <br /><br />
                i'm available for work and commissions. check out the contact section for more.
                
                <br /><br />
                feel free to look around!
